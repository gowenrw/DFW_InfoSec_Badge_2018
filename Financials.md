# Financials

This is a list of the financial information associated with this badge.
This will include:

* A list of all the expenses and real costs associated with these.
    * Prototype board manufacture
    * Prototype test components
    * Production board manufacture
    * Production components
    * Production accessories (lanyard, etc.)
* A unit cost breakdown
    * Cost per board without components
    * Cost per board with components
* Price points and potential revenue for BSidesDFW (the non-profit receiving the money after expenses).
    * Price per board without components
    * Price per board with components

Note that all of these numbers are based off an assumption that we will be producing
300 PCBs, 150 of which will include all the components.
Update: Given the local demand for the kits had to source additional components to bring the totals
up to 180 kits with all the components.

#### Expense Table

| Category                     | Actual    | Projected | Total     |
| ---------------------------- |:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| Prototype board manufacture  | $40.84    | $0.00     | $40.84    |
| Prototype test components    | $280.27   | $0.00     | $280.27   |
| Production board manufacture | $840.20   | $0.00     | $840.20   |
| Production components        | $1423.99  | $0.00     | $1423.99  |
| Production accessories       | $245.91   | $0.00     | $245.91   |
| Totals                       | $2831.21  | $0.00     | $2831.21  |

## Unit Cost Breakdown

Notes on the unit cost breakdown:
* Expenses from above will be divided out across the boards for the unit cost breakdown
* Total PCB count of 300
* Total kits (components to be paired with PCBs above) of ~~150~~ 180
    * NOTE: Based on the increased number of DFW area kit sales I needed to source additional kits
* Not counting the 10 prototype boards since they will get messed up in testing
* Including prototype costs in the overall costs for the production unit breakdown

#### Unit Cost Table

| Category                                   | Total     | Qty | Unit Cost |
| ------------------------------------------ |:---------:|:---:|:---------:|
| PCB and Lanyard Only                       | $703.61   | 130 | $5.41     |
| Kit including PCB, Lanyard, and Components | $2127.60  | 180 | $11.82    |

How these numbers were derived:
* PCB/Lanyard Cost is (Prototype board manufacture /2) + (Prototype test components /2) + (Production board manufacture /2) + (Production accessories /2)
* Kit Cost is (Prototype board manufacture /2) + (Prototype test components /2) + (Production board manufacture /2) + (Production accessories /2) + (Production components)

## Price Points

Beyond recovering manufacture costs we want to raise money for the non-profit BSidesDFW.
With that in mind these are the current price points (subject to change):

#### Early Bird Adopters (DFW Area Purchases)

| Category                                   | Price | Avail Qty | Potential Non-Profit Revenue  |
| ------------------------------------------ |:-----:|:---------:|:-----------------------------:|
| PCB and Lanyard Only                       | $10   | 40        | $400.00 - $216.40 = $183.60   |
| Kit including PCB, Lanyard, and Components | $20   | 90        | $1800.00 - $1063.80 = $736.20 |

#### Hacker Summer Camp Prices

| Category                                   | Price | Avail Qty | Potential Non-Profit Revenue   |
| ------------------------------------------ |:-----:|:---------:|:------------------------------:|
| PCB and Lanyard Only                       | $20   | 80        | $1600.00 - $432.80 = $1167.20  |
| Kit including PCB, Lanyard, and Components | $40   | 90        | $3600.00 - $1063.80 = $2536.20 |

Our original goal was to raise $5k for the non-profit BSidesDFW after expenses.
These price points will get us close to that goal.  
Specifically they should bring about $4620 to support BSidesDFW if all sell as planned.

## Updates

All of the Actual costs are in place now.

Costs came in higher than originally planned due to switching to a coin cell battery design
instead of 9V and having to source additional parts to make more kits.

Will track all sales here after the Vegas conferences are over.
