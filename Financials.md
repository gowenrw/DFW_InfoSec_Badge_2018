# Financials

This is a list of the financial information associated with this badge.
This will include:

* A list of all the expenses and real costs associated with these.
    * Prototype board manufacture
    * Prototype test components
    * Production board manufacture
    * Production components
    * Production accessories (lanyard, etc.)
* A unit cost breakdown
    * Cost per board without components
    * Cost per board with components
* Price points and potential revenue for BSidesDFW (the non-profit receiving the money after expenses).
    * Price per board without components
    * Price per board with components

Note that all of these numbers are based off an assumption that we will be producing
300 PCBs, 150 of which will include all the components.
