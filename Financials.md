This will include:

* A list of all the expenses and real costs associated with these.
    * Prototype board manufacture
    * Prototype test components
    * Production board manufacture
    * Production components
    * Production accessories (lanyard, etc.)

#### Expense Table

| Category                     | Actual    | Projected | Total     |
| ---------------------------- |:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| Prototype board manufacture  | $40.84    | $0.00     | $40.84    |
| Prototype test components    | $280.27   | $0.00     | $280.27   |
| Production board manufacture | $840.20   | $0.00     | $840.20   |
| Production components        | $808.17   | $236.00   | $1044.17  |
| Production accessories       | $108.53   | $16.00    | $124.53   |
| Totals                       | $2078.01  | $252.00   | $2330.01  |

## Unit Cost Breakdown

Notes on the unit cost breakdown:
* Expenses from above will be divided out across the boards for the unit cost breakdown
* Total PCB count of 300
* Total kits (components to be paired with PCBs above) of 150
* Not counting the 10 prototype boards since they will get messed up in testing
* Including prototype costs in the overall costs for the production unit breakdown

#### Unit Cost Table

| Category                                   | Total     | Qty | Unit Cost |
| ------------------------------------------ |:---------:|:---:|:---------:|
| PCB and Lanyard Only                       | $642.92   | 150 | $4.29     |
| Kit including PCB, Lanyard, and Components | $1687.09  | 150 | $11.25    |

How these numbers were derived:
* PCB/Lanyard Cost is (Prototype board manufacture /2) + (Prototype test components /2) + (Production board manufacture /2) + (Production accessories /2)
* Kit Cost is (Prototype board manufacture /2) + (Prototype test components /2) + (Production board manufacture /2) + (Production accessories /2) + (Production components)

## Price Points

Beyond recovering manufacture costs we want to raise money for the non-profit BSidesDFW.
With that in mind these are the current price points (subject to change):

#### Early Bird Adopters (DFW Area Purchases)

| Category                                   | Price | Avail Qty | Potential Non-Profit Revenue |
| ------------------------------------------ |:-----:|:---------:|:----------------------------:|
| PCB and Lanyard Only                       | $10   | 40        | $400.00 - $171.60 = $228.40  |
| Kit including PCB, Lanyard, and Components | $20   | 40        | $800.00 - $450.00 = $350.00  |

#### Hacker Summer Camp Prices

| Category                                   | Price | Avail Qty | Potential Non-Profit Revenue   |
| ------------------------------------------ |:-----:|:---------:|:------------------------------:|
| PCB and Lanyard Only                       | $20   | 110       | $2200.00 - $471.90 = $1728.10  |
| Kit including PCB, Lanyard, and Components | $40   | 110       | $4400.00 - $1237.50 = $3162.50 |

Our goal is to raise $5k for the non-profit BSidesDFW after expenses.
These price points will get us there if we sell all 300 boards.

## Updates

As the projected costs are flushed out with actual costs this will be updated.

Most of the Actual costs are in place now.
Coming in a bit higher than projected but within tolerance.
Switching to a coin cell battery design instead of 9V accounts for the extra costs.
But this is worth it in the end as it is a better design.
