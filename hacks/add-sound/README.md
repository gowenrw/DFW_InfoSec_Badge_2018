# Add Sound

This is a quick little hack to add some sound to the badge.

The idea is fairly simple: add a tiny 8 ohm speaker to the center of the star on the badge
connected to unused Arduino pins and program it to play sounds in sync with LED lights.

The idea of playing sounds without the need for a sound file came from this project:

I got it to play "Deep in the heart of Texas" on a tiny speaker plugged into A5 and GND.

The code is up to date now.

I made a small video of it working which is posted here as well.

Enjoy.
