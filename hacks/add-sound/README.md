# Add Sound

This is a quick little hack to add some sound to the badge.

The idea is fairly simple: add a tiny 8 ohm speaker to the center of the star on the badge
connected to unused Arduino pins and program it to play sounds in sync with LED lights.

The idea of playing sounds without the need for a sound file came from this project:

NOTE: This is a work in progress and not yet complete.
