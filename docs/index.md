## DIY Badge Say What?!?

This badge is an educational build it yourself kit that will help teach people the following:

* Basic Electronics and Soldering
* Arduino Hardware Development and Programming

Local DFW area badge building classes will be scheduled soon.

## Show Me The Money!

All funds raised by the sale of this badge after production costs will go to BSidesDFW which is a 501c3 non-profit.

These badges will be sold at [BSidesLV](https://www.bsideslv.org/) and [DEFCON](https://defcon.org/).
