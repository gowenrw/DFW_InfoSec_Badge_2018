# Components

This section contains a list of all the components that we will be testing with
and information about them.

We will be testing various types of LED's and battery connectors etc.

This will eventually lead to a final bill of materials for the badge.

## Arduino Nano v3.0

The board was designed to take an Arduino Nano v3.0 and it's associated pin out.

The place I am sourcing these from in China uses the cheaper CH340 USB chip.
This means that on some machines (Windows) you will need a CH340 driver to connect to the Arduino.

This is the link to the CH340 chip manufacturer website for details on the CH340 and driver download links:
